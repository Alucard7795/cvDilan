I have experience in web and more recently in mobile development, mainly using react / react native. I have really enjoyed working with React, as it is a framework that allows you to build robust in- terfaces in a couple of seconds with just a cou- ple of steps, taking advantage of all the work built by the community. Also, how not to recog- nize that it is built in such an important and ver- satile language as Javascript. The simple fact of being a framework supported by Facebook considerably optimizes the software thanks to its very active community.'}
